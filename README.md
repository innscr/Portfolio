#### 📝 About me

Hi! I’m **Inga**, an Application Developer moving into test automation role, with 3+ years of background in .NET development (refactoring apps, VB ➜ C#, HTML4 ➜ HTML5 migrations with W3C compliance)

During these projects, I also performed extensive manual testing, including UI validation and exploratory tests, which helped me gain practical skills in web technologies and sparked my strong interest in quality assurance.

On projects I owned **manual testing** (UI validation, exploratory) and gradually moved into **test automation**.

**What I bring**
- Solid web fundamentals (DOM, HTML5, CSS, basic JS, C#, .Net), understanding of CI/CD.
- Clear defect reporting, risk-based testing, strong exploratory skills.
- Professional approach to automation.
